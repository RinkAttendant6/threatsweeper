# EOG Threat Hunt Minesweeper

A game I developed to practise using the React JavaScript framework.

The game is written entirely in TypeScript with React components.

## Development

1. Install Node.js if you don't have it already
1. In this project, run `npm install`
1. Start the built-in dev server by running `npm start`
1. Open your page in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Production build

```
npm ci
npm run build
# output will be in the dist folder
```
